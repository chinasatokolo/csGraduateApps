# csGraduateApps
A curated list of application resources for prospective graduate students in Computer Science and related fields. List created by [Chinasa T. Okolo](http://www.chinasaokolo.com), a Computer Science PhD graduate from Cornell. Feel free to fork and make pull requests with new opportunities!

There are dozens of PhD programs in Computer Science (based in the United States) that accept applicants each year, so I won't list them out here but will provide resources to help you along your journey. Fortunately, many departments have started applicant support programs for underrepresented students (primarily PhD students) applying to their respective programs! Check out the list below:

For programs I have not seen updates for the upcoming application cycle, they are listed as "Status Unknown".

**In the process of updating 2024-2025 deadlines! This [list](https://www.andrewkuz.net/public/dashboards/cs-hci-phd-application-review-programs/2025/html/cs-hci-phd-application-review-programs-2025.html) by Andrew Kuznetsov may also be useful.**

Please note that these programs are primarily for underrepresented students who have little access to external support in preparing their graduate school applications. Given the limited support available by many of these programs, it is important to be thoughtful in applying to these programs.

## Resources for Applying to CS Graduate Programs
When applying to graduate school, my main thesis was set in two parts: (1) the program had to be a top program (top 25 or so) in CS (2) there had to be at least 2-3 professors that I was interested in working with in the department. To be honest, I applied to schools outside of the top 25, like Emory and Washington University in St. Louis (WashU), but they also had other strong departments in medicine, computational biology, etc., that aligned with my interests at the time. To this point, I believe that my second criteria was much more important than my first criteria. It's nice to be in a top-tier program, but if you aren't doing research you're passionate about, it kind of weakens the point of pursuing a PhD. I was fortunate to get both, but this may not always be possible.

Also, [Black in AI](https://blackinai2020.vercel.app/) recently relaunched their [ Emerging Leaders in AI](https://blackinai.github.io/post/academic_programs/) to support Black students applying to graduate programs! If you'd like to mentor, the [interest form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScbTkbxzuep4PdGhvZmxZCTktP8l90OqVR7Ma25WjJVWOHtWQ/viewform) is still open. The deadline has not opened for mentees, so stay tuned for future program updates! I've been involved with this organization for years and will be serving as a mentor for a few preparatory sessions later this November.

[Queer in AI](https://www.queerinai.com) also launched their [Graduate School Application Program](https://www.queerinai.com/grad-app-aid) last year. If you have the means, please [donate](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=5S54QTPH8WCAG) to their Grad App Fund.
